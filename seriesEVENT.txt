Created virtual environment, upgraded pip via pip install --upgrade pip 
Created requirements.txt

Installed pytorch for CPU via 
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

Ran the requirements.txt script via 
pip install -r requirements.txt

Verified the installation setup by running the script
python verify_setup.py

Installed the RTKLIB via
cd ~
mkdir -p tools
cd tools
git clone https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB.git
cd RTKLIB
ls 
cd app/

# Compile rnx2rtkp (RTK post-processing - most important for your project)
cd rnx2rtkp/gcc

source venv/bin/activate
Run the test_rtklib.py script via python rtklib.py

Created folders:
broadcast/tests/
gnss/tests/
ai/tests/

Created files:
__init__.py in the directories :
broadcast and broadcast/tests
gnss and gnss/tests
ai and ai/tests

Verified them by the command 
(venv) rishi@LOQ-15ARP9:/media/rishi/New SSD/PROJECT_AND_RESEARCH/BUILD-A-THON_4/CODE$ python -c "from setuptools import find_packages; print(find_packages())"
Got the output:
['ai', 'broadcast', 'gnss', 'ai.tests', 'broadcast.tests', 'gnss.tests']

In the broadcast directory, namely:
__init__.py ; config.py ; utils.py ; alpencoder.py

In the broadcast/test directory, namely:
__init__.py ; test_alpencoder.py

Created a file setup.py in the CODE directory and ran the command pip install -e.
Now run the command 
pytest broadcast/tests/test_alpencoder.py -v # to verify all the test cases pass or not

Create a file fecencoder.py in the broadcast directory and test_fecencoder.py in broadcast/test
directory
Ran the file test_fecencoder.py file via:
pytest broadcast/tests/test_fecencoder.py -v
This passed all the 17 test cases

Created a file framebuilder.py in the broadcast directory and test_framebuilder.py in broadcast/tests
directory.
Ran the file test_framebuilder.py file via:
pytest broadcast/tests/test_framebuilder.py -v
This passes all the 24 test cases

Did the same for ofdmmodulator.pu and test_ofdmmodulator.py file and ran it via:
pytest broadcast/tests/test_ofdmmodulator.py -v

Created a file called pipeline.py file and test_pipleline.py file and ran it via:
pytest broadcast/tests/test_pipeline.py -v

Ran all the files together via:
pytest broadcast/tests/ -v

Created a file demo_broadcast_pipleline.py file outside the "broadcast" directory but inside the "CODE" directory
Ran it via:
python demo_broadcast_pipeline.py

Created a directory inside the OUTPUTs directory named as Video where all screen-recordings shall be pushed.
